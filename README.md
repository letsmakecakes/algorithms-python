## Introduction

### What are Data Structures?
Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. They provide a way to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.

### What are Algorithms?
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are the building blocks for complex computer programs and are essential for programming and computer science.

## Data Structures
