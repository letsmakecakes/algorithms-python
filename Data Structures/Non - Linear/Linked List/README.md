## What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists don't store elements in contiguous memory locations.

### Basic Structure
```
[Node 1] -> [Node 2] -> [Node 3] -> ... -> [Node N] -> null
```

Each node contains:
- Data (the actual value)
- Reference(s) to other node(s)

## Types of Linked Lists

### 1. Singly Linked List
- Each node points to the next node
- Last node points to null
```
[Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|null]
```

### 2. Doubly Linked List
- Each node points to both next and previous nodes
- First node's previous points to null
- Last node's next points to null
```
null <- [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|null]
```

### 3. Circular Linked List
- Last node points back to the first node
```
[Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -┐
     ^                                     |
     └-------------------------------------┘
```

## Basic Operations

### Core Operations
1. **Insertion**
   - At beginning (O(1))
   - At end (O(1) with tail pointer, O(n) without)
   - At position (O(n))

2. **Deletion**
   - From beginning (O(1))
   - From end (O(n))
   - From position (O(n))

3. **Traversal**
   - Forward traversal (O(n))
   - Backward traversal (O(n), only in doubly linked lists)

4. **Search**
   - Finding an element (O(n))

## Common Applications

1. **System Programming**
   - Implementation of stacks and queues
   - Memory allocation and deallocation
   - Undo functionality in software

2. **Real-world Applications**
   - Music playlist (songs linked to each other)
   - Image viewer (previous and next functionality)
   - Browser history navigation
   - Hash chaining in hash tables

3. **Operating Systems**
   - Process scheduling
   - Memory management
   - File system management

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
1. Dynamic size
2. Easy insertion and deletion
3. Efficient memory utilization
4. Flexible for implementing other data structures
5. No memory wastage

### Disadvantages
1. Extra memory for references
2. No random access
3. Not cache-friendly
4. Reverse traversal difficult in singly linked lists
5. More complex implementation compared to arrays

## Comparison with Arrays

| Aspect | Linked List | Array |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Memory | Dynamic | Static |
| Insertion | O(1) at known position | O(n) |
| Deletion | O(1) at known position | O(n) |
| Access | O(n) | O(1) |
| Cache Performance | Poor | Good |
| Memory Usage | Extra for references | Only data |

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Node Structure (Python)
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

### Common Operations Pseudocode
```
Insert at Beginning:
1. Create new node
2. Set new node's next to current head
3. Set head to new node

Delete from Position:
1. Traverse to previous node
2. Update previous node's next
3. Delete target node
```

## Interview Tips

### Common Interview Questions
1. Detect cycle in a linked list
2. Find middle element
3. Reverse a linked list
4. Merge two sorted linked lists
5. Check if linked list is palindrome

### Problem-Solving Approaches
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**
   - Fast and slow pointers
   - Multiple traversal pointers

2. **Dummy Node Method**
   - Helpful in insertion/deletion
   - Simplifies edge cases

3. **Floyd's Cycle Detection**
   - Cycle detection
   - Finding loop start
